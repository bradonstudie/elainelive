        Cesare Borgia arranged a banquet in his chambers in the Vatican with
        &quot;fifty honest prostitutes&quot;,[2] called courtesans, who danced
        after dinner with the attendants and others who were present, at first
        in their garments, then naked.[3] After dinner the candelabra with the
        burning candles were taken from the tables and placed on the floor, and
        chestnuts were strewn around, which the naked courtesans picked up,
        creeping on hands and knees between the chandeliers, while the Pope,
        Cesare, and his sister Lucretia looked on. Finally, prizes were
        announced for those who could perform the act most often with the
        courtesans, such as tunics of silk, shoes, barrets, and other things.
